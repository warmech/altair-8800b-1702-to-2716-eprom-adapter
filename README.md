# Altair 8800B 1702-to-2716/2732 EPROM Adapter
This is a small adapter to allow 2716/2732 EPROMs to be used in place of 1702 EPROMs in an Altair 8800B, though you should be able to use this in just about anything a 1702 is used in. It has been designed to be as small as possible in order to fit in the cramped quarters of the 8800B's Display/Control PCB. Although the reference image seen below shows the 27XX EPROM soldered into place and 0.1" header pins used in the adapter's 1702 male connector, the 27XX should be socketed on this adapter and fine machine pins in a 1x12 configuration should be used for the male pins that bind the adapter to the 1702's socket in the D/C board.

This design is presently untested and I am awaiting a set to be fabricated. Once I have tested this adapter in my 8800B, I will update this disclaimer to indicate as much. Until this disclaimer is updated and/or removed, this PCB is to be strictly treated as experimental only. User beware â€“ these project and fabrication files are provided with absolutely zero guarantees.
